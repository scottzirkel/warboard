# Feature List

## Pending

### Architecture
- **Generic wargear system** - handle all units consistently:
  - Replacement vs Addition patterns (flag in data)
  - Paired loadouts (weapons grouped as single choice)
  - Per-model limits ("1 model" vs "any number")
  - Wargear abilities (auto-apply stat modifiers like +1W, +1OC)
- **Leader attachment** - attach characters to units & apply modifiers

### Nice to Have
- Livewire Flux UI components (if migrating to Laravel)

## Completed
- ~~dropdown icon spacing~~
- ~~add enhancements to quick reference~~
- ~~per-model damage tracking~~
