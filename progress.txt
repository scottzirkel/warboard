## [patterns-001] Add pattern field to loadout options data structure

**Date:** 2026-01-22

**Decisions:**
- Added `pattern` field to loadout options with two values: "replacement" and "addition"
- "replacement" indicates the choice swaps out the default weapon (mutually exclusive options)
- "addition" indicates the choice adds equipment while keeping base weapon (non-exclusive options)
- All main-weapon type loadouts are "replacement" pattern
- All vexilla type loadouts are "addition" pattern

**Files changed:**
- `data/custodes.json` - Added pattern field to all 8 loadout options across 5 units
  - Custodian Guard: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Custodian Wardens: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Allarus Custodians: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Shield-Captain: main-weapon (replacement)
  - Knight-Centura: loadout (replacement)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added documentation for Loadout Option data structure and pattern values

**Verification:**
- npm run build passes

## [limits-001] Add maxModels field to loadout choice data structure

**Date:** 2026-01-22

**Decisions:**
- Added `maxModels` field to loadout choices to limit how many models can take a specific option
- Field is optional - omit for choices available to all models in the unit
- Used for rules like "1 model can be equipped with a vexilla" → `maxModels: 1`
- Applied to all three vexilla choices across Custodian Guard, Custodian Wardens, and Allarus Custodians

**Files changed:**
- `data/custodes.json` - Added `maxModels: 1` to vexilla choices (3 occurrences)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added "Loadout Choice Fields" documentation section explaining `id`, `name`, `default`, and `maxModels` fields

**Verification:**
- npm run build passes
