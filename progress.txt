## [patterns-001] Add pattern field to loadout options data structure

**Date:** 2026-01-22

**Decisions:**
- Added `pattern` field to loadout options with two values: "replacement" and "addition"
- "replacement" indicates the choice swaps out the default weapon (mutually exclusive options)
- "addition" indicates the choice adds equipment while keeping base weapon (non-exclusive options)
- All main-weapon type loadouts are "replacement" pattern
- All vexilla type loadouts are "addition" pattern

**Files changed:**
- `data/custodes.json` - Added pattern field to all 8 loadout options across 5 units
  - Custodian Guard: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Custodian Wardens: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Allarus Custodians: main-weapon (replacement), vexilla (addition)
  - Shield-Captain: main-weapon (replacement)
  - Knight-Centura: loadout (replacement)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added documentation for Loadout Option data structure and pattern values

**Verification:**
- npm run build passes
